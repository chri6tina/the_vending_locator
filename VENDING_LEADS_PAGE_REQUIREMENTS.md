## VENDING LEADS CITY PAGE STRUCTURE

### Understanding
Each vending leads city page should be a comprehensive, location-specific "home page" for that area that:

âœ… **Feels like a dedicated home page** for that specific city/state
âœ… **Has an enhanced hero section** similar to the main home page
âœ… **Contains extremely tailored content** specific to that location
âœ… **Includes location-specific FAQs** about the area
âœ… **Makes Google see it as high-quality content** for that specific location and purpose
âœ… **Helps vendors understand how you help them in that specific area**

### Page Examples
- `/vending-leads/jacksonville-florida`
- `/vending-leads/austin-texas`
- `/vending-leads/los-angeles-california`
- etc.

### Required Structure for Each City Page

- **Location-specific headline** (e.g., "Vending Machine Locations in Jacksonville, Florida")
- **City-specific value proposition** 
- **Local statistics** (population, businesses, etc.)
- **Location-specific CTA buttons**
- **Professional, home-page quality design**
- **MUST match home page background** (warm-white, NOT harsh blue)
- **Same styling and layout** as main home page hero

#### 2. Location-Specific Content

### Goal
Make each page feel like a dedicated homepage for that specific location, with Google recognizing it as high-quality, comprehensive content specifically for that area and purpose.
